# LinearSVM

SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. 
It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

A program to train a linear SVM using thedataset given in file ionosphere.data and test it using some unseen data.
